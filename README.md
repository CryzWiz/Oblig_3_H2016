This is the psudo code I started out with

/* Psudo code
  DFS(source):
	  stack <- new Deque
	  visited <- {} // empty set
	  stack.push(source)
	  while (stack is not empty):
	    current <- s.pop()
	    if (current is not visited):
	       	set visited to true and add current to search order
	    	  get currents neighbors
	    
	    	for every neighbor:
	        	stack.push(v)
	*/
